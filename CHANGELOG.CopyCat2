Typos in a few routines which were causing exports and imports to sporadically fail.

## V6.2   2022-08-05

## Added
Prior to import, we now execute a routine to ensure all source files contain the target URI
within all aspects of the system (journeys, application, Social IDP, etc).  This is done as
the import files still contain references to the source environment.
